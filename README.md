# DDA6_Name_Stats_Baseball
First PowerBI Dashboard Project

We were tasked with creating a dashboard using any of the previous data we had worked with so I chose the Lahman Baseball Data (found in lahman.tar).

I took each person's first and last name separately and ran a query to create a table of every player in the mlb in the data set that matched either of our first or last names to create a dashboard based on that data. After I had that completed, I ran an additional query to create an amalgamation of our first and last names to find players who matched both a first and last name.
